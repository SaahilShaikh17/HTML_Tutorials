      <aside>This is basically a tag used to put aside content which do not play a part in your main content helping in SEO as the search enginer would not consider the content to be a part of your main page thereby getting you a higher SEO ranking and making sure you put aside space for ads.</aside>

      <div>
         <p>Lol LOL LOL this tag basically has only one job,i.e., to contain other elements. It basically is a non-semantic tag and is a container for other HTML elements. It can be used to group similar types of tags and content together. One key attribute of this tag is that it takes up the entire width of the page for itself. No matter how much space it takes, if you inspect the element you would be able to see how much the block of the page it occupies. Block elements are basically that take up the entire space of the webpage.</p>
      </div>

      <span>
         Well then say goodbye to div cause the span tag only takes up width that is required and doesn't end up taking the entire space as a selfish little person. It is nice and considerate and only takes up width that is required.
